<b>Filter tips</b> 
<p>
It is good practice to select a project first, for example CORDEX. Second step could be selecting a variable (tas) and time frequency (mon). This reduces the number of search results already.<br/>
E.g: project Cordex --> time_frequency mon --> variable tas reduces the number of results from 420824 to 387.
